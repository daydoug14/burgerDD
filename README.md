# Node Express Handlebars

### Overview

Here I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). I followed the MVC design pattern; used Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.
Simply click on a Burger to "devour" it and it will appear below in the list of devoured burgers.  Then click on "Not Devour," and it reappear move back to the original menu.
